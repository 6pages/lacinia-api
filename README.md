# Lacinia API

## What is this?

Base project for building [lacinia](https://github.com/walmartlabs/lacinia)-based GraphQL API services.

This project builds on lacinia with:

+ [component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component)-based system dependency management
+ flexible deployment targets including 
  + as a [Pedestal](https://github.com/pedestal/pedestal)-based service
  + directly on AWS Lambda


## Status

Unstable.

I (@adamtait) am building this template/base project primarily for my
own use. My need is to quickly setup and have a standard tool for
managing a wide range of GraphQL services. I primarily run these
services on AWS & Google Cloud.

All the contents of the project are subject to change dramatically
without notice.

Also, things may not work.


## Contribute

I welcome contributions and fixes though my response will be subject
to my availability (which tends to be low).

If I'm blocking you, you're welcome to fork.
